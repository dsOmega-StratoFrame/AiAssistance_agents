# AI Assistance agents

Personal agentic systems for day-to-day AI Assistance.

## KBN

Requires `invoke` & `start-llm-container` external task available in
`shared-scripts`.

```bash
make start-llm-container
pixi run kbn
```

## [Methodology chosen][2]

[Data Science Lifecycle Process][1].
See [Branch Types][3] for branching naming model.

If working in data science workflow, a jira ticket can be used instead of issue number when creating Data Science Lifecycle Process branches
(`<ProjectAbbreviation>-#`). Also a `_` is used as delimiter between
branch type + number and description of the branch. For example,
experiment and model branches made while working on RAN-73 will be:
`experiment/RAN-73_classification-EBM`
`model/RAN-73_custom-churn-classification`
